/**
 * The obstacle course is a long rolling log connecting two ends of a cliff
 * that crosses over a raging river below.   The log is old, and can only
 * allow a certain number of Woolies on it at the same time.  The Woolies
 * arrive to the course and are allowed to enter the course in the order
 * they arrive.  Woolies can only cross the log when there is room on it,
 * and it is moving.  The Kraken is in control of turning the course off and
 * on in order to handle any Woolies that fall of it.  If a Woolie falls, any
 * Woolies currently crossing the course must return to the back of the line
 * to try to cross again.
